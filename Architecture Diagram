Great! Here’s how we can outline the first section of your document:

---

## 1. Homepage - Tiles Section

### Overview
The homepage is divided into three primary tiles that display event counts:
1. *Todos Events*
2. *Recent Events*
3. *Upcoming Events*

Each tile dynamically updates based on data fetched from respective API calls when the homepage loads. The counts represent the current state of events for the user.

### API Interaction Flow

- *Todos Events Tile*: Calls GET /api/todos/count to retrieve the number of todos.
- *Recent Events Tile*: Calls GET /api/events/recent/count for recent events count.
- *Upcoming Events Tile*: Calls GET /api/events/upcoming/count to get upcoming events count.

### Data Flow
1. *On Page Load*: When the homepage is initialized, all three API calls are triggered simultaneously.
2. *API Response Handling*: Once data is retrieved from each API, the respective tile displays the count.

### Diagram
The following diagram represents the interaction between the homepage and the APIs:

Step 2

2. Expanded View for Events

Overview

Each event tile on the homepage (Todos, Recent Events, Upcoming Events) expands into a detailed table view when clicked. By default, the Todos tile’s data is displayed when the homepage loads. The data in the table is segmented by programs, and each program has its own tab displaying relevant data.

Flow Details

	1.	Default View (Todos):
	•	When the homepage loads, the Todos tile is automatically expanded below the tiles.
	•	All event counts from the tiles are still displayed above.
	•	The table is split by programs. If there are three programs, the view will have three tabs, each tab showing a table of data specific to the program.
	2.	Tab and Table Structure:
	•	Program Tabs: Each tab corresponds to a program. The tab’s header displays the program name and the count of events for that program.
	•	Tables: Each tab contains a table with columns representing specific data points for the events in that program.

API Interaction Flow

	•	Additional API Calls:
	•	For each tile, there is an API call to retrieve the program details (program ID and count of events for that program).
	•	The data retrieved is used to populate the tabs and tables.

Data Flow for Expanded View:

	1.	Tile Click: When a tile is clicked, a corresponding API call is made to retrieve program-level data.
	2.	Program Tab Display: Based on the API response, the homepage renders a set of tabs (one per program) below the tile section.
	3.	Table Population: Inside each tab, a table is populated with data for that specific program.

Let me know how this looks so far! I’ll wait for the next step to continue.
