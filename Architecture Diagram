Great! Here’s how we can outline the first section of your document:

## 1. Homepage - Tiles Section

### Overview
The homepage is divided into three primary tiles that display event counts:
1. *Todos Events*
2. *Recent Events*
3. *Upcoming Events*

Each tile dynamically updates based on data fetched from respective API calls when the homepage loads. The counts represent the current state of events for the user.

### API Interaction Flow

- *Todos Events Tile*: Calls GET /api/todos/count to retrieve the number of todos.
- *Recent Events Tile*: Calls GET /api/events/recent/count for recent events count.
- *Upcoming Events Tile*: Calls GET /api/events/upcoming/count to get upcoming events count.

### Data Flow
1. *On Page Load*: When the homepage is initialized, all three API calls are triggered simultaneously.
2. *API Response Handling*: Once data is retrieved from each API, the respective tile displays the count.

### Diagram
The following diagram represents the interaction between the homepage and the APIs:

Let me know how this looks so far! I’ll wait for the next step to continue.
